## Part 1: The Decision Framework

Before answering any AWS scenario, ask yourself:

1. **What's the problem?** (Availability, scalability, cost, security, decoupling)
2. **What are the constraints?** (Managed vs self-managed, budget, time)
3. **Which service fits the pattern?**

## Part 2: Service Quick Reference (What They Do)

### Monitoring & Security

| **Service** | **Purpose** | **When to Use** |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **CloudWatch** | Metrics, logs, alarms | Monitoring everything |
| **CloudWatch Agent** | OS-level metrics (memory, swap) | When you need memory/disk metrics from EC2 |
| **Macie** | Detect PII in S3 using ML | Compliance, data security audits |
| **Inspector** | Vulnerability scanning on EC2 | Security compliance, finding CVEs |
| **GuardDuty** | Threat detection (intelligent) | Security monitoring, unusual activity |

**Key Distinction:** 
- **Macie** = "What data is in my S3 buckets?" (PII discovery)
- **Inspector** = "Are my EC2 instances vulnerable?" (CVEs, patches)
- **GuardDuty** = "Is someone attacking me?" (threat detection)

### Databases

| **Service** | **Purpose** | **Pattern** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **RDS Multi-AZ** | High availability | Sync replica in another AZ, automatic failover |
| **RDS Read Replicas** | Read scaling | Async replicas, offload read traffic |
| **Aurora** | MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible, better performance | Auto-scaling storage, 15 replicas, faster failover |
| **DynamoDB** | NoSQL, serverless | Key-value, single-digit millisecond latency |

### Networking

| **Service** | **Purpose** | **Key Detail** |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **NAT Gateway** | Private subnet → Internet | Managed, HA per AZ, in public subnet |
| **NAT Instance** | Same as above | Self-managed EC2, legacy, not HA |
| **Internet Gateway** | VPC ↔ Internet | 1 per VPC, public subnets |
| **VPC Endpoints** | Private connection to AWS services | No internet traversal, private subnet access |

### Decoupling & Messaging

| **Service** | **Purpose** | **Key Detail** |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **SQS** | Queue (1:1 consumer) | At-least-once, retains messages, retry logic |
| **SNS** | Pub/Sub (1:many) | No message retention, push only |
| **EventBridge** | Event bus (advanced) | Rules-based routing, SaaS integrations |

**Critical Distinction:**
- **SQS** = Buffer between producer and consumer (messages wait)
- **SNS** = Fan-out to multiple subscribers (messages pushed)
- **Pattern:** SNS → Multiple SQS queues → Different consumers

### Compute & Scaling

| **Service** | **Purpose** | **Pattern** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **ALB/ELB** | Distribute traffic | Health checks, target groups, path-based routing |
| **Auto Scaling** | Scale EC2 based on demand | Launch templates, scaling policies, across AZs |
| **Lambda** | Serverless compute | Event-driven, ephemeral, no servers |

## Part 3: Common Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: High Availability Database

**Scenario:** "Our RDS instance failed and took 30 minutes to recover."

**Solution:**
- **Multi-AZ RDS** - Automatic failover to standby in different AZ
- Failover time: 60-120 seconds
- **Not** for read scaling (standby doesn't serve reads)

**Alternative:** Aurora - 60-second failover (faster), auto-scaling storage

---

### Pattern 2: Read-Heavy Application

**Scenario:** "Database CPU at 90% from read queries, but writes are fine."

**Solution:**
- **RDS Read Replicas** - Create 1-5 replicas
- Application routes reads to replica endpoint
- Primary handles writes only

**Architecture:**
```
Application → Write to Primary
           → Read from Replica(s) (round-robin)
```

**If they ask about Multi-AZ:** "That's for HA, not read scaling. Multi-AZ gives me a standby for failover, but it doesn't serve read traffic."

---

### Pattern 3: Decoupled Processing

**Scenario:** "When users upload files, the processing sometimes fails and we lose data. Also, during traffic spikes, the system slows down."

**Solution:**
- **SQS queue** between upload and processing
- Upload service → sends message to SQS
- Worker service/Lambda → polls SQS, processes
- If processing fails, message reappears after visibility timeout

**Benefits:**
- Buffer during spikes
- Retry on failure automatically
- No data loss
- Can scale workers independently

---

### Pattern 4: Private Subnet Internet Access

**Scenario:** "Our app servers are in private subnets for security, but they need to download security patches."

**Solution:**
- **NAT Gateway** in public subnet
- Private subnet route table → 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
- NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway

**High Availability Version:**
- NAT Gateway in **each AZ** (public subnet)
- Private subnets in AZ A → NAT Gateway A
- Private subnets in AZ B → NAT Gateway B
- Avoids cross-AZ data transfer costs

---

### Pattern 5: S3 Data Security & Compliance

**Scenario:** "We need to detect if any PII (credit cards, SSNs) is stored in S3 buckets."

**Solution:**
- **Amazon Macie** - ML-powered PII discovery
- Scans S3 buckets automatically
- Alerts on findings via EventBridge → SNS

**Not Inspector:** "Inspector is for EC2 vulnerability scanning, not S3 object content."

---

### Pattern 6: Cost Optimization for Data Transfer

**Scenario:** "We're paying high data transfer costs for users downloading large files from S3."

**Solution:**
- **S3 Requester Pays** - Data owner pays storage, requester pays transfer
- Use when sharing large datasets (research, public datasets)
- Requester must be authenticated

---

### Pattern 7: OS-Level Monitoring

**Scenario:** "CloudWatch shows CPU at 50%, but our application is crashing due to memory issues."

**Solution:**
- **CloudWatch Agent** on EC2
- Default EC2 metrics don't include memory/swap/disk
- Agent pushes custom metrics for memory usage, swap, disk space

**Why:** "EC2 hypervisor doesn't have visibility into guest OS memory, so we need the agent inside the instance."

---

### Pattern 8: Multi-Service Resource Management

**Scenario:** "We have 200 resources across 10 services, and we need to find all resources related to 'production' environment."

**Solution:**
- **Resource Groups & Tag Editor**
- Tag resources: `Environment: Production`
- Tag Editor can search across all regions and services
- Find resources by tags quickly

---

### Pattern 9: Fan-out Architecture

**Scenario:** "When a user signs up, we need to send email, update CRM, trigger onboarding, and log analytics."

**Solution:**
- **SNS Topic** for user signup events
- Multiple **SQS queues** subscribed to SNS:
  - Queue 1 → Email service
  - Queue 2 → CRM sync
  - Queue 3 → Onboarding workflow
  - Queue 4 → Analytics
- Each consumer processes independently

**Why not just SQS:** "SNS allows 1 message to fan out to many consumers. With just SQS, each consumer would need its own message, requiring the producer to send multiple times."

---

## Part 4: Situational Questions (No Code, Just Pattern Recognition)

### Q1: "Our web application experiences traffic spikes. During spikes, the database connection pool maxes out and users see errors. We want to buffer the requests."

**Answer:** Place an **SQS queue** between the web tier and the processing tier. Web tier acknowledges request immediately by sending to SQS. Workers process at their own pace. This decouples the spike from the database.

---

### Q2: "We need to make our application highly available across two availability zones. The application is stateless. How do we set this up?"

**Answer:**
- **ALB** across both AZs
- **Auto Scaling Group** with instances in both AZs
- **RDS Multi-AZ** (if using relational database)
- If one AZ fails, ALB routes traffic to healthy AZ, Auto Scaling launches new instances, RDS fails over automatically

---

### Q3: "We have a legacy application running on a single EC2 instance. We need high availability without rewriting the application."

**Answer:** 
- Create AMI of existing instance
- Set up **Auto Scaling Group** with desired = min = max = 2 (or more)
- Put instances across multiple AZs
- **ALB** in front with health checks
- If instance fails, Auto Scaling replaces automatically

---

### Q4: "We need to run database queries for analytics that are slowing down our production database. How do we isolate this?"

**Answer:**
- Create **RDS Read Replica**
- Run all analytics queries on the replica
- Replica stays in sync asynchronously
- Production primary unaffected

---

### Q5: "Our application needs to process video uploads. Processing takes 5-10 minutes. Currently, users wait with a loading spinner."

**Answer:**
- **Decouple** with SQS
- Upload service → SQS → Worker (EC2/Lambda)
- Return 202 Accepted immediately
- Notify user via **SNS** (email, webhook) when complete
- Better UX, handles variable processing times

---

### Q6: "We need to ensure our EC2 instances are patched against known vulnerabilities."

**Answer:**
- **Amazon Inspector** scans EC2 instances for CVEs
- Identifies missing patches
- Can automate remediation with Systems Manager
- Regular assessment runs

---

### Q7: "Our finance team found S3 buckets containing credit card numbers in plain text. How do we prevent this?"

**Answer:**
- **Amazon Macie** to detect PII automatically
- Set up alerts via EventBridge when PII detected
- Implement S3 Block Public Access
- Encryption at rest (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS)

---

### Q8: "We want to reduce costs by only paying for resources when they're used. Our application has predictable nightly batch jobs."

**Answer:**
- Use **Auto Scaling** with scheduled scaling
- Scale up EC2 instances before batch window
- Scale down to zero or minimal after completion
- Or move to **Lambda** if jobs fit within 15-minute execution window

---

### Q9: "Our microservices are tightly coupled. When one service fails, it cascades."

**Answer:**
- Implement **SQS** between services
- Use **Dead Letter Queues** for failed messages
- Add **circuit breakers** in application logic
- Services communicate via queues, not direct HTTP calls

---

### Q10: "We need to find all EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets tagged as 'Production' across all regions."

**Answer:**
- **AWS Resource Groups & Tag Editor**
- Search by tag: `Environment: Production`
- Tag Editor shows resources across all services and regions
- No need to check region by region

---

## Part 5: Quick Decision Matrix

| **Problem** | **Wrong Answer** | **Right Answer** |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|

| Detect PII in S3 | Inspector | Macie |
| Scan EC2 for CVEs | Macie | Inspector |
| Private subnet internet | Internet Gateway | NAT Gateway |
| Decouple services | Direct HTTP | SQS/SNS |
| Fan-out to many consumers | Multiple SQS sends | SNS → Multiple SQS |
| Find resources by tag | Manual search per region | Resource Groups Tag Editor |
